# Window Size

Please capture all samples at a viewport size of 1100x900.

# Positive Samples

The most important thing is to accumulate a wide variety of login pages: different positioning of elements, different markup. Be sure to get banks and credit-card companies.

Please tag them like this:

“username”: the username or email field. Please tag the actual <input> element.
“password”: the input element that takes the password
“next”: the “log in” button (or whatever you click to advance to the next step)

On 2-page flows that make you enter the username, click a button, then enter the password on a new or changed page, do 2 captures: one with the username field visible and another with the password field visible. Tag a "next" button each time if applicable.

## Change-Password Forms

We will also grab some change-password forms. On these, we'll label the password field, since we might want to autofill it. In the rare case there is a username field, label that, too.

# Negative Samples

Please be sure to capture some false-positive bait. That is, grab some samples that have *no login forms* but that do have input fields that might trick a computer into thinking they do. For example, these have been known to trick Firefox's current autofill:

   * Registration forms (for making new accounts)
   * Credit card payment-info forms (which often have name and security-code fields)
   * Shipping forms (again with the name fields)

For those samples, just don't tag anything, and any forms Fathom falsely identifies will cause the optimizer to self-flagellate until it shapes up.

## Forgot-Password Forms

Don't label anything on these for now. I figure we don't want to risk filling them out and auto-clicking the Next button.
